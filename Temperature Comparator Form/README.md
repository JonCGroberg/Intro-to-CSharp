Write a Visual Studio 2019 Windows Forms Application that allows a user to input five daily Fahrenheit temperatures that must range from −30 to 130; if a temperature is out of range, require the user to reenter it. If no temperature is lower than any previous one, display a message Getting warmer. If every temperature is lower than the previous one, display a message Getting cooler. If the temperatures are not entered in either ascending or descending order, display a message It’s a mixed bag . Finally, display the average of the temperatures. Use the Controls that you think are best for each function. Label items appropriately, and use fonts and colors to achieve an attractive design. Include a Close button to exit the application.
